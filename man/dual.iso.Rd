\usage{
dual.iso(iso1, n11, n12, iso2 = 0, n21 = 0, n22 = 0, exp.base, exp.iso,
  ppm = 100, rt.dif = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{iso1}{the first labled atom in precusor ion}

\item{n11}{the maximum numbers of the first labled atoms expected in the labeled intermediates}

\item{n12}{the minimum numbers of the first labled atoms expected in the labeled intermediates}

\item{iso2}{the second labled atom in the same precusor ion, if exist. it is 0 by default}

\item{n21}{the maximum numbers of the second labled atoms expected in the labeled intermediates}

\item{n22}{the minimum numbers of the second labled atoms expected in the labeled intermediates}

\item{exp.base}{the control group (fed with unlabled precusor)}

\item{exp.iso}{isotope labeled group}

\item{ppm}{mass tolarance}

\item{rt.dif}{retention time tolarance}
}
\value{
results containing unlabled and their corresponding labled analytes, with their RT and labeling information
}
