## Description

Filtering dual isotope labeled analytes

R package for dual isotope labeling
A fast and efficient approach for fishing out the dual isotope labeled analytes
Can be easily extended to multiple isotope labeling experiments
Attention

This packgage is xcms based. xcms processing is crucial for the subsequent processing, either false positive or false negative results from xcms can strongly affect the number of selected isotope labeled analytes. It is therefore recommend to well optimize the xcms parameters.
